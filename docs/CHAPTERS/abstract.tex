\section*{Abstract}


This document describes the system architecture of F-Low, an online platform that connects customers to restaurants. To gain more knowledge about the system and the different elements in it, a set of UML diagrams and text descriptions is presented. This is a standardized and objective way for representing the architecture. To this point, some basic use cases have been described both in text and as a use case diagram, concerning different actors. The rest of the system will be presented in future iterations of this project.
